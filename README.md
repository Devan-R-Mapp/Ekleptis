### **Themes **

Our game centers around the dual themes of Alchemy and Shadow, providing a unique and immersive experience for players. These themes are intricately woven into the gameplay, setting, and narrative, creating a rich and compelling world.

**Alchemy** plays a pivotal role in the game play. The Crucible, an ancient and mystical device deposited into a desolate land, allows players to transform basic resources that are collected around the playable map into powerful weapons and player upgrades. This transformation process is not only crucial for progression but also adds a layer of depth. Players must decide how to best utilize their limited resources to maximize their strength and capabilities. Alchemy embodies the idea of change and transformation, instead of focusing on the connotation for potions and brewing only.

**Shadows** are a constant presence in our game, serving as both allies and enemies. The planet is home to a variety of shadow creatures, some of which will challenge the player's skills and strategies. With further versions, we plan on implementing a way to allow the player to utilize the very darkness they fight to arm themselves.

The game is set on a mysterious planet surrounded by a belt of moons, both natural and unnatural. resulting in frequent and dramatic solar eclipses. These eclipses are not just a visual spectacle but also a core gameplay mechanic.



* **Daytime**: During the day, players encounter a trickle of enemies, providing a manageable but constant challenge. This allows players to gather resources, plan their strategies, and prepare for the more intense battles to come.
* **Solar Eclipses**: During a solar eclipse, the world is plunged into **shadows**, and the frequency and intensity of enemy encounters spike dramatically. This creates moments of high tension and excitement, forcing players to adapt quickly and utilize all their skills and resources to survive. These periods of intense combat test the player's preparedness and strategic thinking, making every eclipse a memorable and thrilling experience.
* **Nighttime**: During the night, players encounter a constant stream of enemies, providing a difficult but constant challenge. This is like the day time but a smaller opportunity to gather resources.


### **Game Summary Pitch**

Ekleptis is a Tower Point Defense game that seamlessly integrates gathering, crafting, and bullet hell mechanics. Players are tasked with setting up strategic defenses to protect their Crucible from relentless waves of enemies. The game challenges players to gather resources, craft powerful weapons and upgrades, and carefully plan their defense strategies to withstand the Cult of Ekleptis onslaught.

Set in a mysterious world with a unique themes of Alchemy and Shadow, Ekleptis offers an immersive experience with its dynamic day and night cycle. However, during the day there are frequent solar eclipses, which ramps up the spawning with huge waves of enemies, testing the player's strategic skills and resourcefulness.
